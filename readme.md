In this use case, I have used Apple stock price data from apple website. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset by performing feature selection, feature scaling using MinMax scalar, and prepared the data 
to be used in LSTM deep learning model (You must know about this before using LSTM). 

After performing EDA, I have used deep learning 'Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)' model to predict the trend of stock prices for next 30 days.
